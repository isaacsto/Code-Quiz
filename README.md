# Code-Quiz

The purpose of this project was to code a webpage that presented a user with a quiz on JavaScript. The goal was to have an interactive site where the user was presented with questions one after another after hitting a start button, while a timer counted down, decrementing by ten at every incorrect answer. The user should also be able to save their initials with their high score/ view the high scores.
